## Caffe App

Caffe App is a modern web application built with Laravel that allows users to manage cafe operations. It supports two types of users, the **waiter** and the **manager**, each with specific roles and access rights.

### Features:
- **Login and Role Management:** Users must log in to access the application. There are two roles: **Waiter** and **Manager**.
- **Tables View:** The waiter can see all available tables. Green tables are free, and red tables indicate an unpaid order.
- **Create Orders:** Waiters can create new orders by clicking on a free table. Orders include categories and products, and there is pagination for managing the product list.
- **Billing:** When an order is unpaid, the waiter can navigate to the billing page to view order details and choose the payment method.
- **Accounts:** Managers can view and paginate through all bills, with the ability to see detailed information for each bill.
- **Statistics:** A statistics page shows the best-selling products, top-performing waiters, and most popular tables.
- **Manager Features:** If the manager is logged in, they have full CRUD functionality to manage employees.

This application uses the **Laravel framework** and offers a smooth, user-friendly interface for managing cafe operations efficiently.
